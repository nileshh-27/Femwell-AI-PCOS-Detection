FemWell – AI-Powered PCOS Screening

FemWell-AI-PCOS-Detection

📌 Project Overview

FemWell is an AI-powered web application developed during Forge Alumunus – Inspira 2025 (24-Hour Hackathon).
It assists in women’s health screening by analyzing ultrasound images, survey responses, and lab results, providing early screening insights for PCOS using machine learning.

⚠️ FemWell is a screening tool and not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.
